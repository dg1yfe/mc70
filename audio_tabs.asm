; Remark:
; these tables only make sense in EVA9 radios, since they posess a
; 4 Bit R2R DAC (for signalling) and a 3 Bit R2R DAC (for private line / CTCSS)
; tables are 256 Bytes to save CPU cycles (e.g. avoid "and #31")
;------
; Sine tables for DTMF Tone generation
; tones of the high group should be 1-4 dB louder than
; tones of the low group according to ETSI ES 201 235-2
; These tables provide tones different by 3.5 dB
